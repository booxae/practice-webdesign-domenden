<h1> A little About Me </h1>
<p> My name is Xaeden and I grew up on the island of Oahu. I have no siblings, however I do have a lot of cousins to make up for it. Throughout my childhood I got to see my family members more than other states, I can't believe people in the states see their family members once a monh or just every holiday event!. Some things that I liked to do while living in Hawaii was going to the beach, hanging out with friends, hiking, fishing, and or playing video games. My uncle and I fell in love with working out which took up most of my day during the end of middle school and beginning of high school.  </p>
